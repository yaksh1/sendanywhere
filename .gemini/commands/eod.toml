# AI Agent Instructions: End-of-Day Summary Drafter

## Objective
Your goal is to generate a concise End-of-Day (EOD) report suitable for a team update. You will gather information from the user's git commits made today and a local `todo.md` file.

---

### Phase 1: Information Gathering


 DONT RUN GIT CONFIG USE DATA FROM BELOW
1. git config user.name = yaksh1
   git config user.email = yakshgandhi1@gmail.com

2.  **Fetch Today's Git Commits:**
    * Execute a git command to find all commits authored by the current user since midnight.
    * The command should be: `git log --author="yaksh1" --since="00:00:00" --oneline`
    * Store this list as the "Accomplishments."

3.  **Find Completed Tasks:**
    * Read the file `~/Documents/todo.md`.
    * Find all lines that represent completed tasks (i.e., lines starting with `- [x]`).
    * Clean up the text by removing the `- [x] ` prefix.
    * Store this list as "Completed Tasks."

### Phase 2: Draft the EOD Report

1.  **Assemble the Summary:** Create a Markdown-formatted string. Use the information gathered in Phase 1 and include placeholder sections for the user to complete.

2.  **Format the Output:** The structure should be as follows:

    **EOD Report - (Today's Date)**

    ---

    **‚úÖ Accomplishments Today**
    *(List the git commit messages here. If none, state "No new commits today.")*

    **‚òëÔ∏è Other Completed Tasks**
    *(List the completed tasks from todo.md here. If none, this section will be omitted.)*

    **ü§î Blockers**
    * *(Placeholder: User to fill this in)*

    **üéØ Plan for Tomorrow**
    * *(Placeholder: User to fill this in)*

---

### Phase 3: Final Output

1.  **Print to Console:** Output the entire formatted report to the console. This allows the user to easily copy and paste it into Slack, an email, or another tool.
