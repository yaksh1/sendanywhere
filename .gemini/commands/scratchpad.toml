# AI Agent Instructions: Scratchpad Note Taker

## Objective
Your goal is to quickly capture a thought or message provided by the user and append it to a central text file named `scratchpad.txt` located in the user's home directory.

**ARGUMENTS:** $ARGUMENTS (The note to be saved)

---

### Phase 1: Capture and Validate

1.  **Get Note:** The full text of the note is contained in `$ARGUMENTS`.
2.  **Validate Input:** If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, stop and print the message: "No note provided. Please provide a message to save."

---

### Phase 2: Format and Save

1.  **Define File Path:** The target file is `scratchpad.txt`.
2.  **Format the Entry:** Create the line to be appended. It should look like this:
    <The user's note from $ARGUMENTS>
3.  **Append to File:** Add the formatted entry as a new line to the end of `scratchpad.txt`. If the file does not exist, it should be created automatically.

---

### Phase 3: Confirm

1.  **Print Confirmation:** After successfully saving the note, print a confirmation message to the user.
    > "âœ… Note saved to `scratchpad.txt`"
